# Pandas

## Lessons:

1. **Creating, Reading and Writing:** You can't work with data if you can't read it. Get started here.
2. **Indexing, Selecting & Assigning:** Pro data scientists do this dozens of times a day. You can, too!
3. **Summary Functions and Maps:** Extract insights from your data.
4. **Grouping and Sorting:** Scale up your level of insight. The more complex the dataset, the more this matters.
5. **Data Types and Missing Values:** Deal with the most common progress-blocking problems.
6. **Renaming and Combining:** Data comes in from many sources. Help it all make sense together.
