# Store Item Demand - Forecasting Challenge.

This competition is provided as a way to explore different time series techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset. The data contains daily sales of 50 items in 10 stores over a period of 5 years (500 different time series in total). For our purpose, we need only one time series so I will arbitrarily take sales of Item 1 at Store 1.

**Objetive:** The objective of this competition is to predict 3 months of item-level sales data at different store locations.
